status_blurb: 'Here you can have a look at how many of the SDG indicators currently can be calculated for Germany. The time series for the calculation of the indicators are based mainly on data of official statistics, as well as on other sources.<br>Not all of the globally agreed SDG indicators can be backed up with time series. There can be various reasons for this: Certain 
  internationally relevant indicators cannot be sensibly calculated for Germany or are to be measured on a global scale only. 
  SDG indicators to which this applies are marked with a grey tag <span class="status notapplicable">&nbspNot applicable </span>.
  For other SDG indicators, not all the necessary statistical source data are available yet. 
  They are recognisable by a red batch <span class="status notstarted">&nbspExploring data sources </span>.
  <br>When there are data available, the SDG indicator is labelled with a green batch <span class="status complete">&nbspReported online </span>. 
  <br>If data are available and are being processed right now, the SDG indicator is marked with an orange tag <span class="status inprogress">&nbspStatistics in process </span>.'
